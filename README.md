# Term-Project

Stuff to do:

	1)Add way to deal with Actors
	
	2)Fix GUI so Labels aren't intersecting the boxes
	
	3)Make GUI consistent throughout all of program (Warning messages, Glossary addition box, etc)
	
	4)Add way to export project to html for presentation
	
Probably more stuff, but that's all I can think of right now that's big.
